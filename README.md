# Detecting Left Ventricular Structural Anomalies
# in Chest Radiographs with Densely Connected
# Convolutional Networks


# Abstract. Early identification of structural cardiac abnormalities in-
# dicative of heart failure is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Chest
# X-rays (CXR) are frequently performed on a broad patient population,
# presenting an opportunity to develop scalable screening tools for struc-
# tural abnormalities associated with stage B or more advanced heart fail-
# ure using deep learning methods. In this study, a model was developed
# to detect severe left ventricular hypertrophy (SLVH) and dilated left
# ventricle (DLV) using CXR. A total of 71,589 chest X-ray images from
# 24,689 unique patients were collected, each acquired within one year
# of an echocardiogram. Labels for SLVH, DLV, and a composite label
# indicating the presence of either condition were derived from echocar-
# diographic measurements. The results obtained by Densely Connected
# Convolutional Network 169 chieved an AUROC of 0.74 for SLVH, 0.79
# for DLV, and 0.77 for the composite label
